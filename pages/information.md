The Conference is organized by the Ruđer Bošković Institute, Zagreb, Croatia (RBI) in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials and Sensing Devices (CEMS).

The main organizer is Laboratory for Ion Beam Interactions, Ruđer Bošković Institute, Zagreb, Croatia.

The group operates the accelerator centre consisting of two tandem accelerators and associated experimental beam lines. It performs basic and interdisciplinary research in the field of interactions of ion beams with matter, and develops methods to characterize and modify properties of matter, with emphasis on nanostructure research.

Part of the activities are connected to applications of analysis methods in biomedicine, environment as well as on research of cultural heritage objects.

The ECAART Conference is held every three years and is the most relevant scientific meeting for professionals working in the field of accelerator based research.

It is an important forum where scientists and students from all over the world present their most recent work and discuss future prospects in application of accelerators in a variety of scientific and industrial fields such as, material science, art, archaeology, life science, environment, etc.
